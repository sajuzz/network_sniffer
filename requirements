How It Works

    Packet Capture:
        The sniff function listens to packets on a specified network interface.
        A callback function (packet_callback) processes each packet.

    Packet Analysis:
        Checks if the packet contains an IP layer.
        Extracts and displays source IP, destination IP, protocol, and a truncated payload (first 50 bytes).

    Ethical Use:
        Includes a disclaimer about ensuring permissions before using the tool.
        Suitable for educational and learning purposes only.

Instructions to Run

    Install dependencies:

pip install scapy

Run the script with administrative privileges (required for sniffing network packets):

sudo python packet_sniffer.py -i <network_interface>

Replace <network_interface> with your network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0).
